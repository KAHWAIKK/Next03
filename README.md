PRIVATE FOLDERS

In Next.js, private folders are directories that Next.js does not expose to the client. These folders are meant for server-side logic, configurations, and other backend-related files that should not be directly accessible from the browser.****

To create a private folder, add an underscore at the start of the folder name
